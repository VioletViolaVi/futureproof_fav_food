            <h1>History of Pizza</h1>
            <p>
              Pizza is the world’s favourite fast food. We eat it everywhere –
              at home, in restaurants, on street corners. Some three billion
              pizzas are sold each year in the United States alone, an average
              of 46 slices per person. But the story of how the humble pizza
              came to enjoy such global dominance reveals much about the history
              of migration, economics and technological change. People have been
              eating pizza, in one form or another, for centuries. As far back
              as antiquity, pieces of flatbread, topped with savouries, served
              as a simple and tasty meal for those who could not afford plates,
              or who were on the go. These early pizzas appear in Virgil’s
              Aeneid. Shortly after arriving in Latium, Aeneas and his crew sat
              down beneath a tree and laid out ‘thin wheaten cakes as platters
              for their meal’. They then scattered them with mushrooms and herbs
              they had found in the woods and guzzled them down, crust and all,
              prompting Aeneas’ son Ascanius to exclaim: “Look! We’ve even eaten
              our plates!”
